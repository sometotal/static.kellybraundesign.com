<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description</span><br>
This legal firm with domestic and international offices provides  services to fortune 500 corporations, regional businesses, nonprofit  organizations, local governments and individuals. The office in downtown South Bend, Indiana had long out grown their former space and relocated within the city. As the cityâ€™s largest  law firm, the practice is active in the community  of South Bend and has  made a long-term commitment to the building and  to the city.</p>
<p>The new location was a complete redesign of the top four floors of an existing fourteen story building for a total of approx 30,000 sqft. connected via an internal stair.Â  Partner and associate offices line the perimeter with secretarial stations opposite. Reception, conference rooms, administration area, and auxiliary support spaces complete the plan. The layout is based on a five foot grid drawn from the buildingâ€™s structural system. The perimeter spaces and corridor have ten foot ceilings while the center area drops to nine foot to support the various building systems.</p>
<p>The longevity of the design was achieved throughÂ  simple andÂ  distinguished layout, detailing and materials.  The new officeÂ  has a sophisticated, professional atmosphere reflecting  the superior service they provide to their clients. Classic, timeless  design will allow them to grow into their new space for years to come.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My Role</span><br>
My involvement on this project began after feasibility studies were done and the client had decided on this location for their new office. The project was a collaborative effort of a core team of about four people in which I was designated as the project designer. I was involved in the development of the concept, space planning, selecting materials, developing presentations, meeting with the client, working with consultants, ceiling/lighting layout, planning power/communication locations, and creating construction drawings.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description</span><br>
This investment office in Minneapolis was opened to support a large investment fund by a leading global private investment firm. The client wanted an office that was professional and sophisticated with a classic design that they could grow into. There was also a desire for the space to be warm in order to offset the cold grey winters in Minnesota. The schedule was very aggressive as there was only six months prior to the launch of the fund, July 2006, to have the office fully functional.</p>
<p>The space includes a reception area, conference room, meeting rooms, open office areas, private offices, a trading floor, copy areas and lunch room. The schedule was maintained through a simple yet refined pallet and construction detailing. Constant communication with the contractors throughout the process helped realize the aggressive time line. A mix of warm neutral colors was used to create a bright space with interest created through dark wood accents. The rich materials and refined detailing provide a classic environment that will adapt as the office matures.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My Role</span><br>
The team was made up of two of us for the most part with some assistance by a third to complete presentations. The preliminary layout was begun prior to my involvement. I worked with the staff on some refinements to the layout of the trading floor furniture, collaborated with my teammate on finish selection and design details, met with the clients for finish presentations, produced construction documents, attending construction meetings & site visits every other week, worked with the contractor throughout the construction phase and punch listing.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description</span><br>
This historic waterfront building is in the heart of San Francisco. The building was originally used for shipping in 1932. As that industry declined, the building was vacant for years. Prior to this renovation it was used for parking. It is now on the National Register of Historic Places as an example of classic San Francisco waterfront architecture. The building has over an acre of public waterfront access featuring a promenade along the pier apron and a public walkway, which goes through the building and extends along the historic railroad tracks that once serviced the warehouse. Two tenants occupy the bulk of the building, The Port of San Francisco at the street front and AMB Property Corporation headquarters at the opposite end. The balance of the building houses Westin Presidio Venture Capitalist, Venture Law Office, and Pier 1 Deli. The project was completed and occupied in 2001.<br>
In order to make the building economically feasible to be used as office space, a second floor was added. Due to strict requirements limiting the amount of modification to the shell of the building, the second floor floats in the center of the space so that it does not disturb the shell. The building is not only historically significant, but it is also environmentally sensitive with a radiant floor system and fresh air for heating and cooling.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My Role</span><br>
I was part of a large team that focused on the 45,000 sq.ft. AMB Office. My responsibilities included: design and detailing the millwork, reception desk and conference room credenzas, drafting and coordination of the interior elevations, freestanding and systems furniture space planning and specifications, and assisting in the coordination of the construction documents. I was also involved with the construction document production for the other spaces in the pier.</p>
<p>The main conference rooms are located adjacent to the reception area. This area has a variety of seating clusters and a touchdown station with phone and data access for guests to plug-in before, after or between meetings.</p>
<p>AMBâ€™s most critical objective was to create an environment that would support a collaborative process. A plan was developed in collaboration with a behavioral analyst, where all of the employees are in open office workstations. This allows open communication as well as access to natural daylight. There are a variety of sizes of conference rooms for private meetings, enclosed phone rooms for private conversations, and a large community area for relaxed collaboration.</p>
<p>In the general office area, Knollâ€™s Currents system furniture was selected to provide an open environment with adequate storage, privacy and support for the technological requirements. The layout creates pods of people with a shared mobile worktable between every two workstations to encourage interaction while providing adequate privacy for individual intensive work. In addition to the conference rooms, phone rooms and community area, other support spaces include two small kitchens, a mailroom, two production rooms, fitness room and a computer training room.</p>
<p>The end of the pier boasts views of the San Francisco Bay, the Bay Bridge, and Treasure Island. In order to take full advantage of this feature, a large community area is located at this end of the office. The two-story space contains a library, coffee bar, cafÃ© seating, lounge seating, two plasma screen televisions, an Internet bar, and a conferencing area with mobile screens for privacy. This space is also outfitted with large, motorized projection screens that drop down from the ceiling for quarterly meetings with the entire staff. In order to accommodate these meetings, most of the furniture and millwork in this area had to be mobile. This is the most intensively used space in the office because of its versatility, beautiful view and comfortable atmosphere.</p>
<p>The AMB office is a dynamic mix of the existing exposed industrial structure with the new construction using translucent channel glass, and a pallet of light warm neutral colors with bright accents throughout. Two story channel glass glowing volumes stand out as features in the space, which enclose clusters of conference rooms. The space is open, warm bright and surrounded by the bay with spectacular views. It is a wonderful place to work.</p>
